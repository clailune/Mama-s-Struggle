# Mama-s-Struggle
Welcome to Mama's Struggle, a video game that puts players in the shoes of a pregnant woman who is facing discrimination in the workplace. The game is based on a story available in the book: Women's bodies, women's lives: an anthology of Philippine fiction and poetry on women's health, edited by Thelma B Kintanar.
